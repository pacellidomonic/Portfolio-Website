                <p class="bubble-name">Python</p>
                <p>I utilize two key Python libraries, Pandas and NumPy, to comprehend and clean data. 
                    These libraries enable me to efficiently analyze and manipulate data, ensuring that the data is ready for visualization.</p>

                <p class="bubble-name">mySQL</p>
                <p>By leveraging my SQL skills, I aim to develop queries and ETL processes that smoothes the way for the extraction and transformation of data for visualization purposes.</p>

                <p class="bubble-name">PowerBi</p>
                <p>My tool of choice for creating data visualization dashboards is Power BI. 
                    To further enhance the visualizations, I utilize the DAX language to create custom measures based on the data. 
                    These measures can then be integrated into the visualizations, which can be styled according to my preferences.</p>
